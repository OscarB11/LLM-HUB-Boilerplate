## Overview

The AI Model Hub is a boilerplate web application designed to help users compare responses from different AI language models side-by-side. This version simulates responses from various models to demonstrate the UI/UX without requiring API keys or making actual API calls.

### Features

- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with light and dark theme support
- **Interactive interface**: Collapsible sections, visual feedback, and animated loading states
- **Response management**: Copy, remove, or regenerate simulated responses
- **Visual comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of multiple AI model outputs
- **Adaptive layout**: Responsive grid adjusts based on the number of selected models
